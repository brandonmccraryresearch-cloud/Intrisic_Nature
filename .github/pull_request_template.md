## 🔴 MANDATORY: Theoretical Correspondence Compliance

**BEFORE MERGING, ALL ITEMS MUST BE CHECKED ✅**

Refer to: `.github/THEORETICAL_CORRESPONDENCE_MANDATE.md`

### 1. Formula Completeness
- [ ] **All formulas cite IRH v21.4 manuscript** (Part 1 or Part 2, Section, Equation)
- [ ] **No oversimplifications** - complete formulas with ALL terms included
- [ ] **Non-perturbative corrections included** where applicable
- [ ] **Approximations justified** with explicit error bounds (e.g., "O(ε²) where ε << 1")
- [ ] **No hardcoded constants** - all values computed or explicitly justified

**Example of CORRECT citation:**
```python
def compute_alpha_inverse() -> float:
    """
    Compute fine-structure constant per IRH v21.4.

    Theoretical Reference:
        IRH v21.4 Part 1, §3.2.2, Eq. 3.4

    Formula (Complete):
        α⁻¹ = (4π²γ̃*/λ̃*) × [1 + corrections...]
    """
```

### 2. Transparency Engine Integration
- [ ] **TransparencyEngine used** for all new computations
- [ ] **Step-by-step derivation logs** emitted
- [ ] **Component-by-component breakdown** provided
- [ ] **Provenance tracking** implemented
- [ ] **Validation checks** included (dimensional consistency, gauge invariance)

**Example usage:**
```python
from src.logging import TransparencyEngine, FULL

engine = TransparencyEngine(verbosity=FULL)
engine.info("Computing observable X", reference="§Y.Z, Eq. N")
engine.step("Step 1: Computing term A")
engine.value("A", computed_A, uncertainty=1e-12)
engine.passed("Computation complete")
```

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- [ ] **Function docstrings** follow NumPy style with theoretical references
- [ ] **Type hints** provided for all parameters and returns
- [ ] **Error handling** appropriate for all edge cases
- [ ] **Dimensional consistency** verified
- [ ] **Known limits checked** (Newtonian, SR, QM where applicable)

### 4. Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit tests added** for all new functions
- [ ] **Integration tests** for cross-module functionality
- [ ] **Theoretical validation tests** against known results
- [ ] **All existing tests still pass** (100% required)
- [ ] **Test coverage** maintained or improved

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **README.md** updated if user-facing changes
- [ ] **TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md** updated if API changes
- [ ] **Notebooks updated** if computational changes
- [ ] **Manuscript citations** verified and accurate
- [ ] **No contradictions** with existing documentation
